This website aims to be an actionable list of steps you can take to free yourself from being data mined, exploited for ad revenue, and placed under surveillance.

### Why does this matter?

First, a simple anecdote. Many people are able to identify with this argument, so it is a useful idea.

> Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." **Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.**

> \- Glenn Greenwald in [Why Privacy Matters - TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters)

The more complicated answer is...

1. **A lack of privacy erodes many other freedoms.** This is a very broad argument, but here's an example with freedom of speech. Someone writing an exposé on a corrupt government would not be able to do it if placed under constant surveillance. They might fear retaliation, or simply be stopped with force.
2. **Information, taken out of context, can be used to frame you.** [Danah Boyd](http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/sunday-commentary/20130614-danah-boyd-the-problem-with-the-i-have-nothing-to-hide-argument.ece), a social media researcher, said that even though "[p]eople often feel immune from state surveillance because they’ve done nothing wrong" an entity or group can distort a person's image and harm one's reputation, or guilt by association can be used to defame a person.
